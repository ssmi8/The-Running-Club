## Wireframes

## Structure
The structure idea for The Running Club was to keep it clean and simple, avoiding content that filled up the whole page.  The idea was to keep it slick and allow the simplicity to help users access the content and navigate through the application easily.

Clean colours of white and black/dark grey have been used to create a crisp look and allow users to focus on the relevant content and important alerts.

The main app for this projects is Running Club Articles blog app.

Throughout the project development, GitHub projects was used.  Click here to view.

## Databases

As The Running Club requires a database, I have created two database models:

ENTER POST MODEL

ENTER COMMENT MODEL

### Post Model:

The Post Model handles article details: title, status, date created/updated, featured image, excerpt and likes.  This model handles the base for confirming user authentication to manage their articles.

The Comment Model handles the content of the comment, the username of the commentor and time/date of the comment being issued.
