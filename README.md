# The Running Club

## About
The Running Club is a platform for avid runners.  The aim of this project is to join the running community in sharing thoughts, ideas and experiences they have faced.  Each user can add an article they feel can help the community, where other users can comment, like they content.  Users can also join group runs through the booking form based on their level of ability.




The live site can be found [here](https://the-running-club.herokuapp.com/).

## Agile Development

### Wireframes

- When designing my project, I wanted to focus more of layout rather than detail, due to my overall goal of keeping the site simple and clean.  I made a few slight changes during the project updates, but kept to the design overall.

    - Home Page:
    ![Home Page Mockup](/documentation/home_page_mockup.jpg "Home Page Mockup")

    - Articles Page:
    ![Articles Page Mockup](/documentation/articles_page_mockup.jpg "Articles Page Mockup")

    - Manage Articles Page:
    ![Manage Page Mockup](/documentation/manage_page_mockup.jpg "Manage Page Mockup")

    - Account Page:
    ![Account Page Mockup](/documentation/my_articles_mockup.jpg "Account Page Mockup")

    - Publish Page:
    ![Publish Page Mockup](/documentation/publish_mockup.jpg "Publish Page Mockup")

    - Edit Page:
    ![Edit Page Mockup](/documentation/edit_article_mockup.jpg "Edit Page Mockup")

    - Register Page:
    ![Register Page Mockup](/documentation/register_page_mockup.jpg "Register Page Mockup")

    - Login Page:
    ![Login Page Mockup](/documentation/login_page_mockup.jpg "Register Page Mockup")


- As the project developed some details of the User stories were reviewed and revised. Changes were made to ensure the delivery of a Miminum Viable Product. As one example, User Story 3 above was updated to a fourth User Story that had to be moved to the Backlog column of the kanban board, and at a later stage of development it was moved into the To Do column.

## Structure
The structure idea for The Running Club was to keep it clean and simple, avoiding content that filled up the whole page.  The idea was to keep it slick and allow the simplicity to help users access the content and navigate through the application easily.

Clean colours of white and black/dark grey have been used to create a crisp look and allow users to focus on the relevant content and important alerts.

The main app for this projects is Running Club Articles blog app.

Throughout the project development, GitHub projects was used.  Click here to view.

## Databases

As The Running Club requires a database, I have created two database models:

![Post Model](/documentation/post_model.jpg "Post Model")

![Comment Model](/documentation/comment_model.jpg "Comment Model")

### Post Model:

The Post Model handles article details: title, status, date created/updated, featured image, excerpt and likes.  This model handles the base for confirming user authentication to manage their articles.

### Comment Model:

The Comment Model handles the content of the comment, the username of the commentor and time/date of the comment being issued.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

## Frameworks, Libraries & Tools Used

- Bootstrap - grid, layout, columns, cards and forms structure.
- Django - django frameworks to manage apps.
- GitHub - to store the overall project repository.
- GitPod - used as workspace for the coding.
- Figma - To design the wireframe of the complete project.
- Google Fonts - For the written content and logo.
- Fontawesome - for social media icons.
- Heroku - for deployment of the project.
- PostgreSQL - database storage.
- Cloudinary - image and static files storage.
- AmIResponsive - responsiveness of the site.
- Lighthouse - used for testing site functionality.
- W3C Markup Validation Service - HTML testing.
- W3C CSS Validation Service - CSS testing.
- PEP8 - Python testing.

## Testing


### Unit Testing

I have used django TestCase for automated testing views, forms and models files.

### Testing Views

- Tested if the views are functioning as expected and returns pages that ther user needs to be at.
    - Testing Index/Home Page view:

    ```ruby
    class TestIndexViews(TestCase):   
        def test_get_index_page(self):
            response = self.client.get('/')
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
            self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'index.html')
            

Result:

![Test Views Result](/documentation/test_views.jpg "Test Views Result")

### Testing Forms:

- Tested Articles Post Form and Comment Form to ensure fields are as expected and the form is submitted to where it should:

    - Testing Article Form:

   ```ruby 
   class TestArticleForm(TestCase):
    def test_post_title_is_required(self):
        form = ArticleForm(({'title': ''}))
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertIn('content', form.errors.keys())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors['title'][0], 'This field is required.')

    def test_post_content_is_required(self):
        form = ArticleForm(({'content': ''}))
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertIn('content', form.errors.keys())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors['content'][0], 'This field is required.')
    
    def test_fields_are_explicit_in_form_metaclass(self):
        form = ArticleForm()
        self.assertEqual(form.Meta.fields, ('title', 'content', 'excerpt',
        'featured_image'))

- Testing Comment Form:
    ```ruby 
    class TestCommentForm(TestCase):
    def test_post_title_is_required(self):
        form = CommentForm(({'body': ''}))
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        self.assertIn('body', form.errors.keys())
        self.assertEqual(form.errors['body'][0], 'This field is required.')

    def test_fields_are_explicit_in_form_metaclass(self):
        form = CommentForm()
        self.assertEqual(form.Meta.fields, ('body',))

Result:
![Test Forms Result](/documentation/test_forms.jpg "Test Forms Result")

### Testing Models:

- Models are tested while testing views and forms as well. But in addition, I tested if the models shows that featured image is a requirement and successfully sent to the database:

    ```ruby 
    class TestModels(TestCase):
    def test_has_featured_image(self):
        self.assertTrue(Post.featured_image)

        

Result:
![Test Models Result](/documentation/test_models.jpg "Test Models Result")


## Validator Testing

### Lighthouse

- Testing results:

![Lighthouse Report](/documentation/lighthousereport.jpg "Lighthouse Report")

## W3C Markup Validation Service

- Errors and Warnings found and issues resolved with all tests passing.

    - Home Page:
    ![Home Validation](/documentation/html_home.jpg "Home Validation")

    - Article Page:
    ![Article Validation](/documentation/html_article.jpg "Article Validation")

![Errors](/documentation/bugs.jpg "Errors")

## W3C CSS Validation Service

![CSS Validation](/documentation/css_validator.jpg "CSS Validation")

## PEP8 Python Validator

PEP8 compliance was checked with pycodestyle due to PEP Online Validator currently down.

I used the following steps to check the compliance:

1. Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle
2. In the workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type the word linter inot the search bar that appears, and clikc on Pythin: Select Linter from the filtered results.
4. Select pycodestyle from the list.
5. PEP8 errors will be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

Once I completed these steps, I did not have an errots underlined, nor any added to the PROBLEMS tab.

## Deployment:

This project was deployed to Heroku. 

Steps to open an account in Heroku:

- Sign Up, if you don't already have an account already.
- After you fill in all require information, and sign in you will be able to create an app.
- Click on New -> Create nee app
- Choose a name for your application and select location you are based.

The initial deployment was immediately after cretaing all the file directories within the repository. This is to ensure and overcome any deployment error before hand and resolve the issue before it gets more complicated.

Steps to Deployment

I have followed Code Institute's [Django Blog Cheat Sheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)

### Step 1: Installing Django and supporting libraries

In the Terminal:

In the settings.py file:

![Step1_2](/documentation/step_1_2.jpg "Step1_2")

In the Terminal:

![Step1](/documentation/step_1_1.jpg "Step1")


### Step 2: Deploying an app to Heroku

Here there are 4 stages:
1. Create the Heroku App
2. Attach the database
3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file
4. Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary

2.1 Create the Heroku app

In Heroku:

![Step2](/documentation/step2_1.jpg "Step2")

2.2 Attach the Database:

In gitpod
