## Unit Testing

I have used django TestCase for automated testing views, forms and models files.

### Testing Views

- Tested if the views are functioning as expected and returns pages that ther user needs to be at.
    - Testing Index/Home Page view:

    `class TestIndexViews(TestCase):`
        `def test_get_index_page(self):`
        `response = self.client.get('/')`
        `self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)`
        `self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'index.html')`
